/**
 * "Board mode" — the bridge between the Mosaic dashboard and this editor (Part 2,
 * STEP 6).
 *
 * How the two apps find each other
 * -------------------------------
 * The dashboard navigates the editor to `#board=<id>`. Both apps are served from
 * the same origin by the same nginx, so they share one IndexedDB. The dashboard
 * owns the `mosaic-dashboard` database (via Dexie); this module talks to the same
 * object stores through the *native* IndexedDB API.
 *
 * Why native IndexedDB and not Dexie here:
 * Dexie is not a dependency of `excalidraw-app`, and adding it would (a) change
 * the editor's bundle and (b) risk a schema-version negotiation with an open
 * connection owned by the dashboard. Opening the database without specifying a
 * version always attaches to whatever version already exists, so the editor can
 * never force a re-creation under Dexie's feet.
 *
 * Why nothing here is renamed
 * ---------------------------
 * The DB name, table names and column names are the dashboard's contract, not
 * brand strings. Renaming them would orphan every board a user has already
 * created. See REBRAND.md for the same rule applied to the editor.
