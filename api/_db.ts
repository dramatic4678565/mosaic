 * `mosaic_uid` is an **anonymous** identifier, not a login. A visitor gets one on

 * password, no email and no recovery, by design — Part 3B adds real auth on top
 * of this without changing the column type.
 *
 * The cookie is *signed*, not encrypted, and that is the correct amount of
 * security here: signing makes a client-supplied uid unforgeable, which is the
 * property that matters for owner scoping. It deliberately does not hide the
 * value — there is nothing secret in a random UUID we minted ourselves.
 *
 * No CORS headers are set anywhere. These are same-origin endpoints; a
 * credentialed cross-origin API would be a needless CSRF surface, and the cookie
 * is SameSite=Lax so a cross-site POST would not carry it anyway.
