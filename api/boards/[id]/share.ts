/**
 * `POST` and `DELETE /api/boards/[id]/share` — create or revoke a share link.
 *
 * One file for both because they are the same resource behind the same guard, and
 * splitting them would duplicate the ownership check that decides whether either may
 * happen at all.
 *
 * ## This is deliberate data exposure
 *
 * A share link lets anyone holding it read the board. That is the feature, and it is
 * also the one place in Mosaic where access comes from possession of a string rather
 * than from an account. Two consequences, both enforced here:
 *
 * - The token is 256 bits of entropy. A short or sequential id would let anyone walk
 *   `/share/1`, `/share/2`, … and read every board anyone ever shared.
 * - Only the owner may mint or revoke one. A share link grants read, never re-share.
 *
 * ## Modes
 *
 * `view` is the only mode that does anything today. `edit` is not accepted: creating
 * a link that cannot work would be worse than not offering the option, so the request
 * is refused up front rather than stored and ignored later.
