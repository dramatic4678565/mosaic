/**
 * `GET /api/boards/shared/[token]` — read a shared board, unauthenticated.
 *
 * **No auth, by design.** The token is the capability; a share link is meant to be
 * pasted into a chat and opened by someone with no Mosaic account. Adding a session
 * requirement would turn sharing into "sharing between people who have already
 * signed up", which is not what the feature is for.
 *
 * That makes this the most security-sensitive route in the codebase, so what it
 * deliberately does *not* do is as important as what it does:
 *
 * - No owner identity, no email, no `owner_uid` in the response. A share link should
 *   not tell you whose it is.
 * - No `scene_version`, no `scene_bytes`. Those are internal bookkeeping.
 * - Only live boards. A trashed board's link stops working, because trashing is how
 *   a user says "this should not be reachable".
 * - The thumbnail is included; it is the whole point of a read-only view, and it is
 *   data the owner chose to save.
 *
 * A miss answers 404 with the same body whether the token was never valid, was
 * revoked, or the board was trashed. Distinguishing them would let anyone probe
 * whether a token once existed.
