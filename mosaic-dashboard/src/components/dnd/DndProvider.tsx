/**
 * Single DndContext for the whole dashboard (STEP 4: drag a board onto a folder).
 *
 * Why it lives at the shell level and not inside BoardGrid: the drop targets are
 * the *sidebar folder rows*, which are a sibling of the grid. A DndContext only
 * covers its own subtree, so scoping it to the grid would leave the sidebar
 * unable to receive drops. One provider around the shell fixes that and keeps a
 * single source of truth for the drag-end handler.
 *
 * Droppable id convention:
 *   `folder:<id>`  → file the board into that folder
 *   `grid`         → drop on the board grid itself = remove from any folder
 * The prefix matters: folder ids are UUIDs and could theoretically collide with
 * board ids, and board ids are used as draggable ids.
