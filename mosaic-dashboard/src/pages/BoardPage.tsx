/**
 * Board editor route (STEP 2 `/board/:id`, STEP 6 editor integration).
 *
 * Architecture note — why an iframe instead of embedding Excalidraw directly:
 * the editor is a *separate Vite app* with its own PWA service worker, its own
 * `EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` and its own fonts. Loading it as an iframe keeps the
 * two apps fully isolated (this is also what preserves Part 1's guarantee that
 * the editor build is untouched) and mirrors how the editor's own embeddable
 * mode works. We talk to it over `postMessage` using a small, versioned
 * protocol defined in `lib/editorBridge.ts`.
 *
 * When the editor is served from the same host it reads the board id from the
 * `#board=<id>` hash (STEP 6), loads the scene from IndexedDB itself, and
 * autosaves. This page's job is to render that iframe, show a back link, and
 * mirror save status back into the dashboard store.
 *
 * ## Why this route is outside the app shell
 *
 * It used to render inside `<AppShell>`, which wraps it in a persistent sidebar
 * plus a padded, scrollable content column. That is right for the board list and
 * wrong for the editor: the sidebar took 248px, the shell's padding took the rest
 * of the gutter, and the iframe was left small. Worse, a flex chain that
 * resolves to zero makes Excalidraw size its canvas to zero and never recover.
 *
 * So `/board/:id` sits beside the shell route rather than inside it, and this
 * page owns a fixed full-viewport layout of its own. `AppShell` is untouched,
 * because every other page still wants it.

/**
 * Builds the editor URL.
 *
 * Always a same-origin relative path. That is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
 * IndexedDB is partitioned per origin and board mode reads scenes straight out
 * of the dashboard's database, so if the editor ended up on another origin it
 * would open an empty board every single time.
 *
 * The mount point comes from VITE_EDITOR_BASE:
 *  - production (Docker/nginx): the editor is served at `/app/`
 *  - dev / e2e: the static preview server mounts it at `/editor/`
 *
 * Reading it from one place rather than hard-coding it is what stops the two
 * deployments from drifting: a wrong path here is a blank iframe with no error.
 *
 * The scene is NOT passed in the URL. The editor hydrates from IndexedDB
 * itself; embedding a possibly multi-megabyte scene in the fragment bloats the
 * URL, leaks board content into browser history, and complicates hydration
 * precedence (which of URL vs DB wins?). One source.
